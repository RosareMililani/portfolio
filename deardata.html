            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              One semester, I decided to take a Data Visualization class. At the
              end of almost all of the weeks, we were to turn in a type of
              reflection piece. One example was to do "Dear Data," which
              utilizes postcards. Each postcard symbolizes the topic learned for
              the week or measure something that happened in a week through data
              visualization. Ideally, you would send it to someone. In which I
              decided to "send" it to my sister. There are a total of 9
              postcards, from Weeks 3 to 12. (Please note that some weeks were
              skipped over.) Here is my version and takes on "Dear Data."

            <h2>Week 3: (2/8/21 - 2/14/21):</h2>
            <p>
              The topics learned this week were scatterplots, scales, and axes.
              One thing that we utilized is this:
              <a href="https://github.com/d3">https://github.com/d3</a>. It is a
              reference document that helped us build visualizations in
              Observable. Also, a handy reference to keep handy in case you need
              to know anything about D3.js. My visualization for the week is
              seeing my activities and classes within a week. I chose this is
              due to my involvement in sports and extracurriculars, so I wanted
              to see how my week plans out.

            <h2>Week 4: (2/15/21 - 2/21/21)</h2>
            <p>
              The topics learned this week were using d3.scaleBand(), various
              transitions, and using enter, update, and exit. In class, we went
              into depth about why we should use them and how to use them. For
              my main visualization, I explored the different transitions that
              are available. You are to solve the riddle; however, obtaining the
              answer is easy. It would look cool if built through a program.
              Yet, feel free to figure it anyways...

            <p>
              The topics learned this week was going through examples of
              enter(), update(), exit(), and also implementing transitions into
              our work. There are various examples of enter, update, and exit.
              It is something that is in our everyday lives. In class, we went
              through these examples. Overall, the use of using these is to help
              break down our data and visualize. We also went through
              transitions and what is needed. For my visualization, I decided to
              include an example of baking cookies using enter, update, and
              exit.

            <h2>Week 6: (3/1/21 - 3/7/21)</h2>
            <p>
              In this week's topics, we covered interactivity and working with
              data. When analyzing and working with data, there are different
              ways you can interact with the data, especially if you are viewing
              it online. One of them is using a tooltip. It allows you to scroll
              over your data and display information that can help improve the
              data's information. Now with working with data, not all data is
              clean and perfect. There are steps to make your data accurate and
              put it to use! These are the steps of acquiring, cleaning,
              analyzing, and visualizing.

            <p>
              For this week, we covered map, filter, reduce, and marks and
              channels. There are many reasons why map, filter, and reduce are
              helpful. Not just for data but used in many other various ways in
              programming. With marks and channels, there are many different
              types that we can use to represent our data. One thing to note is
              to use too many marks and channels, since it may not come out to a
              good example. Just a heads up! As for my visualization, I chose to
              use K-pop groups and put them through using map, filter, and
              reduce.

            <h2>Week 8 & 9: (3/15/21 - 3/28/21)</h2>
            <p>
              The topics we learned we learned were perception and pre-attentive
              visual, color, various charts, and layouts. Pre-attentive visuals
              are composed of color, form, movement, and spatial positioning.
              These allow us to understand data quickly and easily. For color,
              it is helpful to a certain extent. Something to keep in mind is
              not to go overboard, only 2-3 colors, max. The chart we all know
              and love are bar charts. It is the one we see in presentations,
              papers, projects, and more. There are a lot more charts out there
              to explore! For my visualization, I chose to showcase a bar,
              donut, pie, and area chart. The data used is the top five boys
              K-pop groups listened to at the time.

            <p>
              For this week, the topics we learned force-directed graphs,
              hierarchical layouts, trees, and clusters. With force-directed
              graphs, we have to figure out what it is consisted of when
              creating them, which consists of force and drag. Hierarchical
              layouts consist of many keys. If there are two keys in the first
              level, there could be more within the next level. With tree
              layouts, these contain parents and children. See the one side of
              the postcard to see how it breaks down. For my visualization, I
              decided to do a layout of HYBE artists at the company, active at
              the time. Please note that one group has disbanded as of now.

              For this week, we learned about node diagrams and maps. We went
              through the various graphs and their use. For example, matrix
              graphs are for comparing two parts of the data. Please see the
              postcard for more details. We also learned about maps, to which
              there are many! Like many other graphs, there are pros and cons to
              using maps. For my visualization, I decided to show the various
              graph charts. And I must say, there are a lot!

            <h2>Week 12: (4/12/21 - 4/18/21)</h2>
            <p>
              This last week, we learned about choropleth and zooming, brushing,
              and applying data visualizations to the real world. With both
              choropleth and zooming there are advantages and disadvantages to
              using them. For choropleth, advantages are grouping and colors.
              However, they are hard to compare to one another. While color is a
              good usage, you need to think about all audiences. During this
              week, we also had a guest speaker. For this, our class split into
              groups to help come up with an idea to help this speaker with his
              current project. It helped me to think about how does parts of
              visualization help in the real world? For my visualization, I
              decided to include tools and charts potentially used in the real
              world.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Overall, this was a fun experience. Looking back, I realized that
              data visualization comes in many forms. While some may be better
              than others, not all are the same. It was fun to do my take on
              Dear Data. If I were to continue this in the future, I would. I
              think it is a fun experience in general. Who knows, I might be
              posting more about it soon. Or more as a hobby! Big shoutout to
              Travis Stodter (the professor for the class) for showing this
              example to us!
