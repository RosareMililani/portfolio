            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>For this project, I broke it down into a few weeks.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Nov 15, 2021 - Nov 21, 2021: Sketches, wireframe, start Figma
                file, and learning more about Flutter
              </li>
              <li>
                Nov 22, 2021 - Nov 28, 2021: Prototype (Figma), begin
                development
              </li>
              <li>
                Nov 29, 2021 - Dec 5, 2021: Keep working on development, some
                user testing
              </li>
              <li>
                Dec 6, 2021 - Dec 12, 2021: Finish anything that is for
                development and deliverables. Some user testing.
              </li>
              <li>Due: Dec 13, 2021 @ 8AM</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              The first step was coming up with an idea, which was more
              difficult than I thought. At the time, I was not sure what I
              wanted to design. One day, my teammate mentioned Animal Crossing.
              From there, I thought it would be an interesting app to make with
              the given API. This game has been with me since my childhood.
              <br /><br />
              After coming up with an idea, I came up with a few designs with
              sketches. With the API I am using, they had many endpoints.
              However, I decided to stick to 3 different ones: villagers, fish,
              and bugs. These are some of the few most important parts of the
              game and what people would like to know as a reference. For my
              app, I wanted to have the following: bottom navigation, splash,
              list information, details, and error page.
              <br /><br />
              From there, I began working in Figma. One thing that is a bit
              different from my sketches and Figma file is the details page
              containing the bottom navigation bar. Also, the Villagers page has
              their representative color listed in the API.
              <br /><br />
              Finally, I moved on to the development process. I struggled at
              first due to the API endpoint. Luckily, the professor and I solved
              the problem to continue working. At first, I was only going to
              load in the fish data and its details when clicked on. However, I
              was able to add bottom navigation, which allowed me to display
              villagers and bugs. The final design contains most of the pages
              and styles initially planned. There is also an errors page,
              similar to the Figma file.
              <br /><br />
              The pages and design that were not part of the final application
              were the splash page and bottom navigation throughout all the
              pages. Overall, due to time constraints and having errors while
              implementing them into the application. Lastly, one thing I did
              mention is user testing. I did not user test; however, I did show
              my designs to individuals throughout my development process.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>
              A user can navigate through the application that contains three
              different endpoints from the Animal Crossing API. They have a
              selection of Villagers, Fish, and Bugs. For all three endpoints,
              there are pieces of data that display upon click. To navigate to
              different data points, the bottom navigation is available with an
              icon and name. If an error were to occur, an error message
              displays, and a picture of the Animal Crossing character: Resetti.
            </p>

            <hr class="major" />
            <h2>Successes</h2>
            <p>
              My original plan was to include three different data endpoints:
              villagers, fish, and bugs. They all successfully are listed when
              clicked on through the bottom navigation. If a user clicks on one
              of the options, they will be presented with information about the
              villager, fish, or bug, with an image displayed above.
            </p>

            <hr class="major" />
            <h2>Issues</h2>
            <p>
              There are no known issues with the current application of loading
              data. However, there are a few designs that could be better.
              Additionally, a splash screen and a constant bottom navigation
              bar, that is not currently implemented. <br /><br />
              There is an error displayed in the terminal, if a user scrolls too
              fast. (Error: The provided ScrollController is currently attached
              to more than one ScrollPosition.) However, this does not affect
              the data being displayed.<br /><br />
              All code is currently in main.dart. For better implementation,
              these ideally would be in separate dart files.
            </p>

            <hr class="major" />
            <h2>Future Development</h2>
            <p>
              There were a few things I was unable to complete for my final app.
              One thing I would have liked to add is a splash page. When
              implementing, I ran into a few problems loading the page and
              displaying information upon click.<br /><br />
              There is also a bit of styling that could be better. For example,
              when it lists the data from the API, there is no spacing. It would
              have looked a bit cleaner with margins in between.<br /><br />
              As I mentioned in the development process, the last thing I would
              have liked to add is bottom navigation that is constant throughout
              all the pages. It did follow my sketches, which I did not add
              bottom navigation. However, for a better user experience, it would
              be nice to have constant bottom navigation. <br /><br />
              Lastly, it would be nice to load in all the data possible. The
              Animal Crossing API documentation has many other endpoints that I
              could use. If I were to implement this, I would remove the bottom
              navigation and create a hamburger widget. It would be the best way
              to display the data and create a better user experience. Also, a
              search page would be nice, to make it easier and quicker for
              searching purposes.
            </p>
