            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
              Have you tried to learn a new language through a course or
              'language learning' app and wound up forgetting about your goal or
              losing motivation? You may have even tried to find a partner to
              hold you accountable and keep you motivated, but finding someone
              can be a struggle. Or, if you did succeed in learning the language
              (congratulations!), you might have learned the grammar and formal
              version of the language. However, holding a conversation with
              someone is probably still challenging due to unfamiliarity with
              everyday language or different dialects.
            </p>

            <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
            <p>
              Our solution is to connect with people who are also trying to
              learn a new language or practice their skills. Finding a community
              of people you enjoy speaking with will provide you with ample
              opportunity to practice and keep your motivation alive. This app
              will allow you to translate your messages in real-time while
              chatting if you need assistance. Thus, it can especially benefit
              amateurs who want to learn a new language without prior knowledge
              since they can immediately start having fun conversing and
              creating connections with others while building their vocabulary.
            </p>

            <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
            <p><b>Members of Our Stakeholders Include:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>People wanting to learn and practice a new language</li>
              <li>
                People who want to practice a language they know but don't use
                daily
              </li>
              <li>Travel enthusiasts</li>
              <li>
                Individuals who want to connect with people from around the
                world
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Goals:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Our stakeholders are looking for a convenient way to:
                <ul>
                  <li>Learn a new language</li>
                  <li>Practice newfound knowledge</li>
                  <li>Maintain skills</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Worries:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Members of the target audience have busy lives and many
                responsibilities. As a result, it is hard for them to be
                consistent and maintain their motivation.
              </li>
              <li>
                In addition to the basics, they want to learn the colloquial
                language so that they can speak comfortably with others.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Involving and Communicating with Stakeholders:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Our stakeholders will initially be involved through interviews,
                and progress will be communicated through emails.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will use our interviews to avoid miscommunication by
                providing definitions for ambiguous terms and asking clarifying
                questions to ensure that all parties are on the same page.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will also give interviewees ample opportunity to ask
                clarifying questions if they need to do so.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lastly, we will be communicating the design of LingoTalk to our
                stakeholders through usability testing.
              </li>

            <p><b>Ideas:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create an algorithm that pairs individuals based on their needs,
                interests, and personalities
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Users first set up their profile by inputting time
                    availability, level, etc., to be paired with others with
                    similar selections
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Give users the ability to create forums to discuss topics of
                interest
              </li>
              <li>
                Allow users to give feedback to improve the application

            <h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
            <h3>Demographics and Tools</h3>
            <p>
              Our project aims to make language learning easier by creating a
              digital community. As a result, our user demographic leans toward
              a younger audience. However, our interview demographic involved
              anyone who has ever wanted, tried, or succeeded in learning a
              different language. All the participants, aged 21 to 35, were from
              various academic or professional backgrounds, including students
              to full-time employees. The interviews were conducted via zoom
              calls and phone calls; some were in-person. The interview audios
              were transcribed over Zoom and Otter.ai but edited individually.
              The insights helped us find different perspectives and information
              that will drive our consecutive steps of this project.

                <li>
                  What is your goal for learning a new language? (i.e., to read
                  books, understand music lyrics, speak to non-English speaking
                  grandparents, know the basics, just for fun, moving to another
                  country, etc.)

                    Do you think our application might have helped you learn

                  <li>

            <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
            <p>
              We used the Affinity diagram for organizing our notes from the
              interviews to understand the user's experiences, frustrations, and
              needs better. We used Zoom to discuss the notes and diagram and
              Figma to work on the diagram collaboratively. The following
              process was followed:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The yellow notes were highlights and notes from individual
                interviews and transcripts.
              </li>
              <li>
                The yellow notes were sorted into groups based on common themes
                and labeled with blue post-its for the middle-level grouping.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once we had similar themes, it was easier to break them into
                smaller groups to identify specific and common information,
                which we clustered under purple post-it notes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lastly, we arranged the blue post-its under top-level labels,
                which are the green post-its, that identified the user's
                experiences, frustrations, and expectations.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>
              From the interviews and interpretation sessions, we gained new
              insights that we can apply to the design of our app. Our
              conclusion with the problems and motivations people have while
              learning a new language are:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                People mostly want to learn a new language to interact with more
                people or to enjoy entertainment from different cultures.
              </li>
              <li>
                Peer interaction and cultural exchange make the learning process
                engaging and motivating for learners.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consistent practice and using the language in the real world
                instead of only reading and watching led to better understanding
                and fast learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                People lose motivation either when they cannot find consistent
                learning methods or cannot find time in their schedule to
                dedicate to their learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                People are concerned about time zone differences, and some feel
                embarrassed to talk to people. This finding also made us realize
                the limitations of our idea.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>
              To create our personas, we researched and considered the
              contextual inquiry's highest level of points. One primary, two
              secondary, and one anti-persona were among the four that we
              developed.

              We used two iterations to construct a low-fidelity prototype for
              our app, with each iteration being more refined regarding purpose,
              layout, and features than the one before. The pain areas,
              experience goals, and end goals of our user personas were used as
              the basis for prototyping.

            <h3>Initial Paper Prototypes</h3>
            <p>
              After collective brainstorming, we took some time to create
              individual sketches or paper prototypes of our ideas for each
              frame. This allowed us to have different perspectives and options.
              Additionally, the visuals helped us have better discussions.

            <h3>Lo-Fi Prototypes</h3>
            <p>
              Lastly, we discussed the paper prototypes, made some changes to
              reduce gaps in the user flow, and consecutively created wireframes
              on Figma. The button below, which is followed by a preview of the
              Figma file, will take you to the Lo-Fi prototype. Lastly, a few
              essential screens can be seen in more detail.

            <h2>Hi-Fi Prototype</h2>
            <p>
              After wireframing, the high-fidelity prototyping stage began by
              working on color and type elements to create a consistent brand
              identity. Through trial, error, and discussions, the following
              style guide was created for the LingoTalk mobile application.
              <br /><br />
              Returning our focus to the interactions and navigation, we started
              enhancing buttons, adding additional frames, and including
              animations to the prototype. The focus of LingoTalk is connecting
              and chatting with others. As a result, the functionality of the
              chat and explore features have more depth in comparison to other
              features. We've excluded frames such as password recovery since
              the design would follow standard conventions.
              <br /><br />
              Additional settings were added to make it easier for users to
              choose the languages they wish to see while chatting with
              others.The questions asked during profile setup will allow the app
              to make appropriate suggestions and populate the explore tab
              initially. This helps to mitigate concerns, such as differences in
              time zone, that were discovered during the contextual inquiry.

            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              Each team member conducted a usability test with one participant,
              so our findings come from the feedback of four users. The users
              were asked to complete the following tasks during the usability
              test:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Log in to your account and complete the setup process</li>
              <li>View the Home page</li>
              <li>From the home page, setup by creating a post</li>
              <li>From the home page, setup by creating a new group</li>
              <li>View the explore page</li>
              <li>View the chat page</li>
              <li>
                Check your latest message (should be Aidan Lee when the user
                clicks on Chat)
              </li>
              <li>Find how to listen to a message</li>
              <li>View the different chat displays for translation</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Found the profile setup process smooth and easy to follow</li>
              <li>
                Quickly found home page, creating post and group icon, explore
                page, and most recent message
              </li>
              <li>
                Appreciated the idea of getting the option to choose how the
                chat would look like
              </li>
              <li>Figured out how to play audio immediately</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>Pain Points</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Some icons are too small to see right away (i.e. create post,
                chat icon)
              </li>
              <li>
                Icons are not consistent with one another (i.e. home page vs.
                group page posts)
              </li>
              <li>Concerned about privacy</li>
              <li>Did not know they could scroll down on suggestions</li>
              <li>Took some time to find translation settings</li>
              <li>Concerned with language the entire app is in</li>
              <li>
                Google translate or translation not always accurate - will there
                be moderators or translators to help?
              </li>
              <li>Chat settings titles were confusing</li>
            </ul>

            <br />
            <h3>Next Iteration</h3>
            <p>
              After discussing findings from the user testing, the following
              list comprises some elements that we could incorporate in our next
              iteration of the prototype.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Make some icons larger (i.e. create post, chat icon)</li>
              <li>
                Add concise information regarding privacy to setup (preferences)
                since people tend not to read privacy policy or terms and
                conditions
              </li>
              <li>
                Have a pop-up message explaining the chat boxes when new users
                click the chat icon for the first time
              </li>
              <li>Make icons more consistent throughout the application</li>
            </ul>

            <hr class="major" />
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Working on LingoTalk has been a great learning experience and has
              allowed us to work on different steps of the design process. A
              considerable aspect has been working and making decisions as a
              team, which has helped us prepare to work with others in a
              professional setting. We've also learned from past mistakes, such
              as incorrectly conducting the contextual inquiry. It would have
              been more appropriate to ask our participants to walk us through
              the language learning apps they use. Since our sample size for
              user testing is small and not representative of our entire target
              audience, conducting more usability tests would lead to better and
              possibly more suggestions for the next iteration of LingoTalk.
