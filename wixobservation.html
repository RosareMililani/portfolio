            <h2>Initial Observations</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Initial Field Observations</h3>
            <p>
              The participant for my initial field observation was a first-time
              user of Wix. It was conducted in person on October 21, 2022, at
              7:25 PM. The participant is a 22-year-old and current female RIT
              student studying Human-Centered Computing from Pennsylvania,
              United States. They presented their laptop in front of me, and I
              watched them create a website of their choosing while I took notes
              on my computer. This observation lasted around 15 minutes, from
              setting up their account to publishing their website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below are my raw observation notes on how they proceeded to use
              Wix. The participant was prompted to create a website of their
              choosing. Also, to speak through their thoughts if there was
              anything to comment upon. The italicized bullet points are
              comments made during the process:

            <h3>1.2 Observation Summary</h3>
            <p>
              For my field observation, I had a first-time user of Wix but have
              a coding and design background. The participant was prompted to
              create an account and then publish their website when done. For
              the first few parts, when creating their website, they quickly
              choose what type of site they would like to build with the various
              themes, layouts, and other prompts. After going through all these
              presets, it took them a while to find out how to edit their site.
              They explored how to create their website. The participant ended
              up spending quite a bit of their time trying to be able to view
              the page. However, in the end, I ended up pointing out where they
              could edit since they said it was too small to notice. They had
              quite a few frustrations during this: editing the actual website,
              trying to add subtext to an image, and project view page. During
              this, they either tried to spend time looking around to see how to
              proceed further or ended up giving up since it did not seem
              possible. Overall, it seems the participant had mixed reactions
              when using Wix. Upon recommendation for others, they mentioned it
              would depend on who they were. For example, those who do not have
              a background in design and code experience can use it, but they
              may need to follow a tutorial in case they get lost. The
              participant mentioned the various things to choose from, such as
              fonts, presets, and templates. Due to their background, they would
              stick to creating their website since it lets others know they can
              code and design and allows for creativity.

            <h3>1.3 Research Questions</h3>
            <p>
              Based on my initial observations, it made me start thinking on
              possible research question our team could investigate:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>How user-friendly is the Wix website?</li>
              <li>Are there specific features that stand-out to users?</li>
              <li>
                Is there additional information needed to create a website on
                your own?
              </li>
              <li>Do users prefer using templates or creating from scratch?</li>
              <li>
                Are users able to create their website in minimal steps without
                any confusion?
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Group Work</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Summary</h3>
            <p>
              Over the years, there have been many website creation platforms to
              help build for professional, student, business use and more. There
              are many individuals who might be interested in using these types
              of sites. For example - business owners might try to build a
              website using such platforms as it does not require much prior
              knowledge and designers might want to use aesthetic templates that
              are readily available for quick use. With many different types of
              website creation platforms, we want to assess if these websites
              are helpful to audiences through its user-friendliness and
              intuitivity without creating many limitations. Therefore, for this
              assignment, we have chosen to evaluate the usability of Wix as a
              website building platform for first-time users and non-coders.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are numerous website building platforms on the internet
              today that have been making it easy for people to build websites
              very quickly and easily. These include Squarespace, Webflow,
              WordPress, Wix, and many others. The reason why individuals use
              Wix is due to the ease of use for beginners, template variations,
              and various features and add-ons. This platform also allows people
              to build a website for both web and mobile layouts, which is very
              useful as much of the population in today's world is a mobile
              user, making it advantageous for individuals to have a mobile
              variation of their website. We wanted to evaluate and confirm if
              Wix promotes the information it entails to its customers and if it
              is up to standard for ease of use. In our field observation, we
              want to see if non-coders and first-time Wix users can easily
              create a website with as much creativity as possible. We also
              wanted to assess how much flexibility Wix allows its users when
              creating a website through its platform. This was done by asking
              the users to create a web page on Wix and observing them
              thoroughly during the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, each of us conducted a field observation with one
              participant that provided us with an insight of non-coders' use of
              the Wix platform through their struggles, preferences, ease of
              finding items on the platform, and comparison to other
              experiences. To further investigate the intuitiveness, usability,
              and to confirm our field observations, each group member conducted
              a data collection session individually with another participant.
              To conduct this effectively, we broke up our analysis into two
              parts. First, we prompted the individual with various tasks and
              then followed up with a few interview questions that would help us
              understand their problems, what they thought was easy to find or
              use and the platform and how their overall experience was. The
              data collected also helped to answer our research questions as we
              collected in-depth information about the usage of the platform.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Research Questions</h3>
            <p>
              With this work, we are trying to answer the following research
              questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                RQ1: What features in Wix are user-friendly to non-coders?
              </li>
              <li>
                RQ2: How quickly can users (specifically, non-coders) create a
                personal, non-commercial website by using Wix?
              </li>
              <li>
                RQ3: Do users prefer using a template over creating a website
                from scratch?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>2.3 Task Walkthrough</h3>
            <p>
              The following tasks were selected to examine the user's actions
              and asked to speak out loud of their thoughts:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Create a site by choosing a template - Creative CV/Portfolio
              </li>
              <li>Create a new section</li>
              <li>
                Change the text to briefly write an introduction paragraph about
                yourself
              </li>
              <li>Change the image to insert your own</li>
              <li>
                Create a new section to insert a contact form on the website
              </li>
              <li>Change the heading font to 'Times New Roman' and at 32 px</li>
              <li>Change the current site theme colors</li>
              <li>Create a new section - a footer on the website</li>
              <li>Add your social links to the footer</li>
              <li>Publish your website and share your link</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2.4 Interview Questions</h3>
            <p>
              The following questions were selected based on multiple team
              meetings. They were presented to the user upon completing the
              usability tasks:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Do you have any prior experience building a website from a
                website building platform?
              </li>
              <li>
                What was the most struggling part when you were using Wix?
              </li>
              <li>
                What part of the experience did you find easy while you were
                building the website?
              </li>
              <li>
                Do you prefer using a template rather than building a website
                from scratch?
              </li>
            </ol>

            <hr class="major" />
            <h2>Individual Conducted Interviews and Reported Interviews</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Background</h3>
            <p>
              The interview section was conducted and recorded over Zoom with
              another individual. This individual was a recent graduate who
              studied Chemistry at UH Manoa. She currently resides in
              California, United States, and is 23 years old. This interview was
              on October 23, 2022, at 9:30 PM EST. The interview lasted about 17
              minutes, from setting up their account to answering interview
              questions.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Task Walkthrough</h3>
            <p>
              The participant was asked to complete ten usability tasks, which
              can be found in Section 2.3 (Task Walk Through). After creating
              their account, they were to build a Creative CV or Portfolio site
              as a template. Once they were on the website, the participant was
              to create sections, change an image, change text font and size,
              theme colors, and add text. For one of the tasks, the participant
              were to change the current text to Times New Roman at 32px. All
              tasks were to see if users can easily navigate through the website
              to prove its user-friendliness and observe the different features
              available. After the tasks walk-through, the participant had four
              follow-up questions about the website seen in 3.5 (Interview
              Questions Response).

            <h3>3.3 List of Problems</h3>
            <p>
              There were not many problems with both the observation and
              interview process. However, below are a list of problems that
              happened during either the observation or interview.
            </p>
            <p><b>Observation</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Once the participant set up their account, they did not know how
                to edit their site upon creating their account.
              </li>
              <li>Felt that it makes you choose a lot of things upfront.</li>
              <li>
                Mentioned the 'Edit Site' button was too small to notice. Which
                I had to help point out.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trying to edit a project view brings you to a new page, which
                felt a limitation to the participant.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Interview</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Missed that you can add a section if you hover in between
                sections.
              </li>
              <li>
                Did not properly change an image; however, it was due to
                confusion when prompted with the task.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              There were not many problems with the interview participant
              compared to the observation participant. It is due to the
              observation individual explored many features and had no guidance.
              Whereas with the interview, the participant restricts to only
              adding certain things to the page. Therefore, there were not many
              problems to be found with them. Another partial reason is trying
              to keep the interview process not as long.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both participants took some time to navigate to the actual site
              editor. They both quickly adapted to the different features that
              add to the website. So, if they wanted to add a new section with a
              particular layout, both participants successfully added it.
              Another point was when both participants finished. They mentioned
              website building platforms are a good starter for those who do not
              know design and coding. There are many things to choose from;
              however, this leads to a limitation on creativity. In the end, the
              observation participant would not use it since they would prefer
              to code theirs. Meanwhile, the interviewee participant would
              likely not use it again since they have no reason to.

            <h3>3.4 Answering the Research Questions</h3>
            <p>
              <b
                >RQ1: What features in Wix are user-friendly to non-coders (and
                first-time users)?</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              The observed participant from the start mentioned how the website
              was not user-friendly and had poor usability. Many things prompted
              them in the beginning to create the site; however, it brought them
              to the site information and website editor, which they could not
              find without obtaining help. While designing the website, they
              complemented Wix by having many options and the capability to see
              it in a mobile view. The participant mentioned one does not need
              to worry about media queries with this feature. Some features they
              thought were user-friendly were the various fonts and animations
              to choose from. Despite Wix implementing many features, this
              participant still felt there was a limitation to creativity and
              not as user-friendly as they thought it would be.
            </p>
            <p>
              The interviewed participant felt there were quite a few things
              within Wix that were user-friendly upon creating their website.
              They mentioned the variety of options to choose from, which allows
              them a bit of creativity. For example, when tasked to change the
              color theme, the participant easily navigated to the correct place
              and changed as many colors as necessary. Another example of a
              feature they felt was user-friendly was the Text Settings. The
              participant quickly was able to change what the elements
              requested. However, one downfall feature they mentioned is adding
              a new section. If an individual wants to add a new section, Wix
              prompts them, “To add, just drag and drop.” They expressed
              annoyance since this was the case for many elements and sections
              when added. Despite this obstacle, they still believed many of the
              features within Wix were user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b
                >RQ2: How quickly can users (specifically, non-coders) create a
                personal, non-commercial website by using Wix?</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Both participants from the observation and interview used
              templates to help them create their websites. After watching both
              participants, it seemed to take about the same time to build their
              website to the desired look. Despite being tasked differently, the
              observed participant had more freedom, and the interviewed
              followed tasks they both found their way around creating the
              website. Both participants easily navigated through the different
              elements and sections to add. Also, looking through the various
              theme colors and fonts to make it more customizable and to their
              preference. Overall, both could create a website as quickly as
              possible if needed or could spend more time to make it more
              personalized. There was no difference in comparison between a
              non-coder and a coder in how quickly they could create a website.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b
                >RQ3: Do users prefer using a template over creating a website
                from scratch?</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              From the observation participant, they mentioned they would prefer
              to create from scratch since it allows them to have more
              creativity. Despite being presented with various elements and ways
              to build their website, they still felt like it created a
              limitation to one's creativity. During the beginning process of
              creating their Wix website, they were confused about how many
              things it took to start working on the website. There were too
              many things to choose from at the start of trying to create the
              site. They also mentioned that due to some factors being
              confusing, some individuals might need a tutorial to get started.
              After going through the Wix website, they decided to show me the
              portfolio website they built using React. They mentioned that it
              allowed them more creativity and could showcase their capability
              to code and design a website.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for the interviewed participant, they also mentioned if you are
              a first-time user or new to creating websites, it would be good.
              On the other hand, if you tend to be more creative, using any
              website-building platform can limit your creativity. While this
              participant used Wix long ago but is a non-coder, they still felt
              confused by the various template styles. Some of the sections they
              were trying to add during one usability task were trying to find
              which best fit their website. At the end of the interview, the
              participant mentioned, “It's pretty good if you're just kind of
              new to it, and you just want something practical.” Overall, it
              bases on what type of user you are and if you need any guidance to
              help build your website.

                <ul>
                  <li>The participant mentioned they used Wix before, but a long time ago. She does not remember what the purpose of using it was for. It also does not look like what it was years ago.</li>

              </li>
              <li>What was the most struggling part when you were using Wix?
                <ul>
                  <li>The participant mentioned there were lots of dragging elements when they were trying to create the website. They also mentioned they did not know if there was a way to make things smaller, to see if anything coordinated well with one another. To be able to view everything, they had to scroll up and down to see website.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>What part of the experience did you find easy while you were building the website?
                <ul>
                  <li>The participant mentioned there were lots of options to pick from. If you are new to creating a website, they (Wix) helps lay it out for you.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Do you prefer using a template rather than building a website from scratch?
                <ul>
                  <li>The participant mentioned if you are a first timer user, it would be good.
