            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>1.1 What we want from design testing</h3>
            <p>
              From our user testing, we want to investigate how users use an
              upgraded version of a popular game console. The console we are
              comparing is the Game Boy, which was heavily used in the XY
              generation. Nowadays, there are many game consoles, but each has
              slowly changed over the years. We would like to see from our Game
              Boy prototype, if we can provide an approachable console for the
              MZ generation.<br /><br />
              In the existing design, there was a sensational element for
              people. The factors were the size of one hand (which was compact)
              and the easy button operation. Based on this and the fact that the
              typical size fits in one hand, we opted to design a trackpad with
              pressure-sense that everyone is acquainted with today. By doing
              this design test, we will be able to determine how convenient the
              newly added contemporary manipulation is for the user and what
              recommendations to offer.
            </p>

            <h3>1.2 Observations</h3>
            <p>
              Both user testing took place on December 12, 2022, from 6 to 8 PM,
              in an apartment room. Both participants were male and current RIT
              students. The user testing lasted around 15 minutes, from
              prompting the introduction about the prototype Game Boy to
              follow-up questions.

            <h3>1.3 Script & Instructions</h3>
            <p>
              The following texts was prompted to participants before asking
              pre-questions about the prototype. These are the introduction and
              explanations given: <br /><br />
              <i
                >Hello, we are HCI graduate students from the Foundations of HCI
                course. First, thank you for taking the time to participate in
                this interview today. We are asking for interviews like this to
                investigate the data on how users interact through the prototype
                we came up with. <br />
                This model we're holding is an upgraded version of the Game Boy,
                which has been used extensively in the XY generations. We
                improved its design by switching the physical up-down buttons
                (directional pad) to a touch-click pad with pressure features,
                to make it approachable for the MZ generation.</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>The following are pre-questions asked to participants:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Have you ever played games like Pokémon, Tetris, Super Mario,
                and The Legend of Zelda on a Game Boy before?
              </li>
              <li>
                If yes, do you remember any of the four-operation button
                functionalities? (Directional pad, start, select, A/B)
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The following text is the process and walkthrough presented to
              participants upon using the Game Boy prototype: <br />
              <i
                >Imagine you met a Pokémon by accident, while you (the
                character) were walking with your Pokémon in the wild. And you
                start the fight. Please follow the instructions below:</i
              >
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Move up (forward): softly click top of trackpad</li>
              <li>Move down: softly click bottom of trackpad</li>
              <li>Move right: softly click right of trackpad</li>
              <li>Move left: softly click left of trackpad</li>
              <li>A (confirm): single tap on middle button of trackpad</li>
              <li>B (cancel): double tap on middle button of trackpad</li>
              <li>
                Yes (OK) function (R): use right finger to click button at side
                of the screen
              </li>
              <li>
                Previous function (L): use left finger to click button at the
                side of the screen
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <i
                >The rules are simple: While you make your way through town and
                the wild, you and your Pokémon must defeat any random Pokémon
                you encounter. You may choose to fight or run away, and if you
                decide to battle, you can use one of your Pokémon's abilities
                and end the fight by using only 5 attacking skills. Defensing is
                not optional. All we ask is that you share loudly what you're
                experiencing and how you expect to advance in this match.</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              The following questions were asked upon finishing user testing:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>What did you think of the game simulation?</li>
              <li>
                Are there any features/moments that you have, while fighting in
                the Pokémon simulation?
              </li>
              <li>Were there any features/moments that you liked?</li>
              <li>What was easy about this task?</li>
              <li>
                Was there anything that surprised you during these tasks? If
                yes, what?
              </li>
              <li>
                From a scale of 1 - 10, what is the satisfaction level of this
                prototype?
              </li>
              <li>
                What suggestions do you have for improving this prototype's
                performance?
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Field Notes</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Pre-question responses</h3>
            <p>
              The asked pre-questions can be found in Section 1.3 (Script and
              Instructions). Both participants stated they have played games
              through the Game Boy. Asking this question helps us understand if
              they are familiar with the interface and would be suitable
              participants for further testing in later prototype designs. Since
              both participants stated yes, they were asked about the
              four-operation button functionalities, which consists of the
              directional pad, start, select, and A/B. To which both
              participants stated they remember the functionalities.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Observation & Interview Comments</h3>
            <p>
              User testing received a favorable reaction. The users reported
              that the new suggestions for interactional changes were
              delightfully amusing and improved their experience. One user in
              particular remarked on how much he enjoyed using the directional
              pad because of how tactile it felt. Another participant noted that
              the arrangement of the directional pad made it much easier to
              operate. People loved how the prototype had a contemporary form
              factor and interaction yet still had the vibe of an old Game Boy.
              "This is making me feel nostalgic, yet the layout feels a lot
              better like this," one user commented. <br /><br />
              Having a single button for both A and B was the only drawback that
              consumers saw and mentioned. Customers were perplexed by two
              exchanges (Single press for A, Double press for B). "I have to
              pause every time and think about the interaction," one participant
              said, "which can slow down the game play for me." Other
              participants were seen doing the same thing, pausing and
              contemplating the interaction each time it was necessary to carry
              it through.

            <h3>2.4 Follow-up Question Responses</h3>
            <p>
              For the first question regarding game simulation, both
              participants said the prototype Game Boy felt it was straight
              forward, had good ergonomics, and had the feeling of the original
              Game Boy. The next question about the inconvenience of
              features/moments during the Pokémon battle simulation, they felt
              the buttons were a bit confusing. Participant 1 mentioned that the
              B button was unintuitive, where Participant 2 was confused since
              the buttons were not separate from each other, unlike the original
              Game Boy console. Both participants then mentioned they liked the
              feature of the trackpad due to giving good tactile feedback and
              use of area. Throughout their gameplay, they felt the prototype
              had given the nostalgic feeling of the old Game Boy console. For
              the satisfaction of the prototype, they both rated it highly of
              8.5 and 7.5, respectively. Lastly, for suggestions, Participant 2
              said that separating the buttons for A and B would be more
              convenient.
            </p>

            <hr class="major" />
            <h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
            <h3>3.1 User Problems</h3>
            <p>
              According to user testing, users felt uneasy with the functioning
              of the A and B buttons (A for confirm, B for cancel). Controlling
              the location with a single button in the middle of the trackpad
              was supposed to reduce finger movement and user fatigue. However,
              in the user testing, both participants said that having separate
              buttons for A and B would make their usage easier. This is because
              learning how to do two functions with a single button took a long
              time when participants were initially executing a button function.
              They thought that an initial description of the method was
              required. What we thought would be a useful design feature turned
              out to be a barrier that needed more thought and effort on the
              side of the user. In the following phase, we plan to enhance the
              prototype based on this input.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Summary of the Process</h3>
            <p>
              We ran across some unforeseen challenges when we were making the
              Game Boy prototype. We underestimated how much effort would be
              required to create a system that would immediately respond to a
              user's click of a button on a trackpad. At first, we thought we
              could create a physical pressure response by folding the paper
              into a spring form, but the material proved to be too weak for
              this to function. We opted to put the pen's spring beneath the
              trackpad and trim it to a set height to facilitate the
              instantaneous reaction of the trackpad, its primary purpose.
              Despite how little spring material was used, the cardboard weighed
              a significant amount and springs were not placed evenly throughout
              which created an uneven balance. There was a noticeable change in
              how the trackpad was used owing to the tiny variation in spring
              height. Tape was added and taped around the bottom of the
              prototype to equal out the uneven balance and flexibility. Because
              of this trial and error, one user showed amazement by describing
              how he discovered this touch.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 What we Learned</h3>
            <p>
              Redesigning the Game Boy with a contemporary aesthetic was a fun
              challenge with the promise of reviving fond childhood memories and
              a renewed appreciation for the console. It was intriguing that
              physical prototypes could be developed with wireframes and
              numerous team members without resorting to specialized procedures.
              Additionally, while building the hard-type prototype and
              explaining each person's comments, consideration was given to the
              specifics of how to make team members and users feel more at ease.
              <br /><br />
              Above all, the benefit of this project was that it could be
              implemented in a short period of time and at a low cost. If this
              Game Boy had to be constructed using a design software and a 3D
              printer, the cost would have been more expensive, as well as
              working with a multi-designer and training time to grasp the
              program. Furthermore, both users and observers may undertake easy
              use processes, allowing for speedy testing and identifying the
              most critical comments.
            </p>

            <h3>3.4 Further Steps & Moving Forward</h3>
            <p>
              One thing we wish we knew before that could have made the process
              more useful is what materials would be good to stimulate features
              and controls of the old Game Boy console. We spent a bit of time
              pondering what might be best to use to create a more tactile
              experience for the buttons. There were not many ideas apart from
              springs that we thought could stimulate a 'bounce-back' feel. From
              the next steps on, we will think about separating the A and B
              buttons, since participants found it unintuitive. Another test
              would be to compare the actual console and this prototype design
              side-by-side, to see if there is a difference between the two. The
              reasoning is to test how fast and see the ease of use the
              participants can use the controls. Additionally testing with more
              participants when moving forward to any next steps of continuing
              our design prototype.
