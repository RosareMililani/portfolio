            <h2>Agency Archetype Approach</h2>
            <p><b>Approach:</b></p>
            <li>
              What's next for the agent portal is around the corner and the
              Small Commercial Digital team is exploring a more personalized
              experience. To create a space that caters to various roles, we had
              to deeply understand who agency roles are through interviews and
              reviewing existing research.
            </li>
            <p><b>Defining Archetypes</b></p>
            <li>
              An archetype is a model that focuses on the behaviors, patterns,
              and responsibilities of users. We use user behavior to create
              stories and customer journeys to understand the user and their
              motivations.
            </li>
            <p><b>Types of Small Commercial Agency Archetypes:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Leader</li>
              <li>Client-oriented</li>
              <li>Bookkeeper</li>
              <li>Supporter</li>
              <li>Company Service Agent</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Why Archetypes:</b></p>
            <li>
              Creating archetypes allows us to visualize our findings and
              analyze various responsibilities and tasks in a mid-sized agency.
              Due to heavy involvements of company service agents, involving
              secondary users will scope how the agency portal should evolve.
            </li>

            <h2>Agency Archetype Overview</h2>
            <p><b>Leader</b></p>
            <li>
              This role's duties vary based on the size of the agency. Typically
              they make important business focused decisions, such as quoting &
              issuing. Leaders may take on various roles within the agency.
            </li>
            <p><b>Client-oriented</b></p>
            <li>
              This role bridges the agency and the company. Client-oriented are
              the main point of communication for agencies and customers. For
              example, selling insurance, processing quotes, various system
              tasks and overseeing other roles like Supporting roles.
            </li>
            <p><b>Bookkeeper</b></p>
            <li>
              This role is to manage accounts' specific books, dues, and verify
              information, with limited access and authorizations in the agency
              portal. The bookkeeper reports to internal roles and has minimal
              interaction with customers. This role can be handled by other
              positions dependent on the size of the agency.
            </li>
            <p><b>Supporter</b></p>
            <li>
              The supporter role supports leaders and client-oriented roles.
              They take on many different roles based on the agency with various
              authorizations within the agency portal.
            </li>
            <p><b>Company Service Agent</b></p>
            <li>
              Take care of phone calls and live chats, internally and externally
              within the agency portals. Also, helping customers navigate issues
              and help with any questions. Lastly, working on documenting and
              reporting issues, which are sent to the company's application
              team.
            </li>
