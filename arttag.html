            <h2>What is ArtTag?</h2>
            <p>
              ArtTag is a drawing experience that allows you to post your
              drawings on walls in AR and see them alongside the drawings of
              other users.
              <br /><br />
              By allowing our users to contribute to their community through
              drawing, we're hoping they explore and discover the artistic
              expressions of the people around them.
            </p>

            <h2>Before Beginning the Project:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>No experience with AR</li>

              <li>
                Reached out to all professors who may have experience with AR
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Not many professors at RIT are “experts” that could give us
                  enough resources
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Did have an idea that we wanted to go through with</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Good concept for theme of "Smile"</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

            <hr class="major" />
            <h2>Building the Application:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Followed through to many professors about AR</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Main Resources: W. Michelle Haris (p5/ar), Travis Stodter
                  (react), Austin Willoughby (mongo, heroku)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Designers changed designs to fit our needs</li>
              <li>
                Had slides and notes in regards to AR, however was not
                compatible with web application
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Vuforia (WebGL)</li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Multiple check-ins with Sten to make sure development was in
                place
              </li>
              <li>AR plans</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Vuforia (WebGL - Unity), Location based (AR.js) > Marker-based
                  (AR.js)
                </li>
                <li>
                  With location based our problem became of not getting specific
                  coordinates. Especially if we were going to be placed at a
                  certain location during ImagineRIT
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Discord Bot</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Accept or Deny image (drawing) to be accepted into the
                  database
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Heroku</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Host site (two)</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Placement/ar view pages</li>
                  <li>Main application (drawing, carousel, gallery, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Did run into a problem during the week of ImagineRIT, due to a
                  breach between GitHub and Heroku
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>P5.js</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Drawings tools - various types (4)</li>

                <li>iOS and Android handle storing “images” differently</li>

                <li>Back button blurs the images</li>

                <li>Got most of the functionality except redo function</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Only working on Android</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <li>Custom Markers</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Was able to create our own markers through a template using
                  our logo
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Devs had many collaborative work periods throughout the weeks
              </li>
            </ul>

            <hr class="major" />
            <h2>During ImagineRIT:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Had to change up design of the application</li>
              <li>Changed throughout about 5 times</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Took out the carousel since it was not compatible with older
                  version phones
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Too many steps to see the final product</li>
              <li>Hard to navigate</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Especially towards younger audiences</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Should have prepared it to be on a specific device</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  More people ended up using the tablets once we brought them
                  out
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Definitely oversaw many individuals since we had to explain the
                process and watch them
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Is there a way to create an easier experience?</li>
                <li>It may have been fine to oversee them</li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Overall experience once everything was in place was satisfying
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Fit the theme of “Smile” at the end of the day</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

            <hr class="major" />
            <h2>Expanding Project & After Thoughts:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Disable using too many QR codes</li>
              <li>
                Carousel page was fine for a regular app, however, with fast and
                quick interactions it became hard
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Try to think about how we can incorporate a faster interaction
                  to get an experience
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Had to clear the database every 20-40 min, depending on foot
                traffic
              </li>
              <li>More specific to AR, images became squished</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  However, the other AR group during Imagine also ran into the
                  same problem
                </li>
                <li>More research with AR</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Is there a way to not use marker-base?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>This should only be thought of after getting down AR</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Scope a bit better (at least with the time span)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Project had a good concept, however, there were faults here
                  and there
                </li>
                <li>Too many markers</li>
              </ul>
              <li>User testing</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We had planned for two user testing sessions, however, this
                  fell through.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Schedule</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Went tangent in the beginning of project, however, was getting
                  work done more so out of order
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Designers assets</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Ended not using some of the designers assets since it was
                  either not compatible or not enough time
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Brushes</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Adding more brushes users can use</li>
                <li>Pen tool was a bit off on some devices</li>
